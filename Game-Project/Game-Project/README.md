# Game-Project
The general repository for our game design.

We are designing a role playing adventure game using a very simplistic user interface.  Most interaction with the game will be 
through text prompts and button presses.  We draw influence from games like "A mess of Trouble" and other more traditional MUDs.

The game will essentially be a MUD, but with a user interface.
